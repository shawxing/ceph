v0.94
-----

* librbd and librados include lttng tracepoints on distros with
  liblttng 2.4 or later (only Ubuntu Trusty for the ceph.com
  packages). When running a daemon that uses these libraries, i.e. an
  application that calls fork(2) or clone(2) without exec(3), you must
  set LD_PRELOAD=liblttng-ust-fork.so.0 to prevent a crash in the
  lttng atexit handler when the process exits. The only ceph tool that
  requires this is rbd-fuse.
* ceph-objectstore-tool and ceph-monstore-tool now enable user to
  rebuild the monitor database from OSDs. This feature is especially
  useful when all monitors fail to boot due to leveldb corruption.

v0.94.3
-------

* The return code for librbd's rbd_aio_read and Image::aio_read API methods no
  longer returns the number of bytes read upon success.  Instead, it returns 0
  upon success and a negative value upon failure.
